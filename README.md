# Homeless Disturbance

**IMPORTANT NOTE** For the record, I am a PHP developer (in particular with the Laravel framework), I am not a professional C# developer, what's shown inside this repository is me learning C#. Bear with me as I go with this and learning, positive critisism is welcome. That being said, I am a firefighter in real life with enough scenario's in my head to process for FivePD, which I am trying to illustrate here.

## Installation

Place the AnimalCruelty.net.dll inside your /callouts folder from FivePD.

## Version

This callout has been built with the latest API (1.1) so it will only support 1.1 or higher versions.

## Issues & bugs

Please report them in the issues tab. Moreover if you know a fix I recommend you create a PR for this.
